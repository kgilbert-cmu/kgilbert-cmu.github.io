    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I got an email today notifying me that <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/stunfisk/comments/1gkhsv/ou_no_more_than_2_weaknesses_to_any_type/">my Stunfisk strategy</a> was voted the #3 strategy of Summer 2013 in the world of competitive Pokemon battling. This is really flattering, honestly. I&#8217;m just an amateur. I haven&#8217;t bought one of the games since the GBA era, and I only keep up to date thanks to <a href="http://smogon.com">Smogon</a> and <a href="http://pokemonshowdown.com/">Pokemon Showdown</a>. I&#8217;m including the entirety of my strategy after the break.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="../../images/blog/scald.png" /></p>

<p>What is any Pokemon team, really? What makes any strategy more effective than another? When I was playing competitive Pokemon, I often found that I felt more comfortable playing <em>reactively</em> than <em>offensively</em>. I enjoyed the challenge of predicting the opponent, or responding correctly to his or her movements on the field. The core concept of this Pokemon team is that it should provide the trainer with no holes, no opportunties for the enemy to cause checkmate. Its goal is simple: no two Pokemon on this team of 6 should share a single type weakness. The most up-to-date type weakness charts can be found <a href="http://www.smogon.com/bw/types/">here</a> and <a href="http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Type_chart">here</a>. Bulbapedia has already provided the Generation 6 (coming out in a little less than two weeks<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>) type chart, while Smogon has yet to update with the new <strong>Fairy</strong> type.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/stunfisk">/r/stunfisk</a> moderator <strong>TheRealQuade</strong> had this to say about my strategy in his review:</p>

<p><span class="pullquote-right" data-pullquote="the fact that it has so few weaknesses and is still multidimensional is quite the accomplishment.">
There are so many ways to build a team that most people use a combination of different strategies to create their own well-rounded team. This one actually commits to the desire to have a full team that doesn&#8217;t have more than one weakness to any type. On top of that, it uses a full slate of 6 strong, OU pokemon and even has some great balance between offense (both physical and special) and defense. I don&#8217;t usually give props to cookie cutter OU teams like this, but the fact that it has so few weaknesses and is still multidimensional is quite the accomplishment.
</span></p>

<p>Man, I feel, like, <em>professional</em>, or something.</p>

<p>I started my team using two renowned stallmates - Ferrothorn and Jellicent. These Pokemon have become infamous for usually being found together, because they are capable of <a href="http://bit.ly/11LzHvW">resisting everything the other is weak to</a>, and that&#8217;s a hard commodity to come by. As an added bonus, both of these juggernauts are defensive-oriented, making them perfect to start the foundation of a team. I decided that because Jellicent can absorb tons of hits on either side of the physical/special spectrum, but Ferrothorn can <strong>only</strong> eat Physical hits, it was important to take another physical tank Pokemon. </p>

<p>I chose Gliscor, whose Flying type also gives a crucial immunity to Ground type moves and who only sports two weaknesses himself. With the defensive core decided, I began piecing together the offensive side. Here, I chose a Dragon type, because Dragons are only weak to Ice - and Dragon. Taking a Dragon Pokemon would prevent me from choosing anything else Ice is super-effective against (Flying, Grass, and Ground), and we&#8217;ve already taken Gliscor (who is both Flying and Ground), so I need to look for a Dragon Pokemon who is not weak to Ice due to a dual-typing. There is only one Dragon pokemon outside of Ubers who is not weak to Ice: Kingdra. Kingdra is a very interesting Pokemon, because he&#8217;s actually ranked UU (or under-used). His stats just aren&#8217;t very menacing, yet his move set and Swift Swim ability can make him a very lethal threat. The problem is that everybody knows what Kingdra&#8217;s going to do when he comes to town: Rain Dance, Swift Swim, and Waterfall/Outrage, in that order. How do we deal with that level of one-dimensionality? I&#8217;ll address this further below.</p>

<p>The final two Pokemon I choose are a Fighting type and an Electric type, which on monotype Pokemon happen to not share any weaknesses with each other or any of the Pokemon I chose so far. Many candidates can fit this mold, but I personally decided to go with Conkeldurr and Jolteon, who are known for hitting like Mack trucks and having decent type coverage when attacking enemies of multiple types.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Ferrothorn</strong> is our Physical wall, trying to keep strong attackers away with his Iron Barbs recoil and in general trying to setup and be as much of a pain in the ass as possible. The problem is that Ferrothorn has <em>too many</em> good moves to pick just 4. The biggest runner-up that didn&#8217;t make it into the moveset is Protect, with a shout-out to Stealth Rock.</li>
  <li><strong>Jellicent</strong> is our Special wall, with as many stalling moves as you can shake a stick at. Will-o-Wisp physical attackers (for that -physical offense debuff) and anything made of Steel (because it&#8217;s immune to Toxic). Toxic the rest.</li>
  <li>I&#8217;ve had trouble trying to figure out what to do with <strong>Gliscor</strong> from a strategy point of view. One of the few guys on this team who can Stealth Rock, but it&#8217;s not like he Stealth Rocks very well at all, and probably worse than Ferrothorn who&#8217;s already hurting for a moveset as it is. Gliscor is nothing if not for his Toxic-Protect-Poison Heal combo, so what should we do with the final two moves, especially if one of them might have to be Stealth Rocks? This is probably one of my biggest flaws on the team (and where I&#8217;d love to hear advice) - I chose to take Gliscor down a very dangerous path by giving him no offensive moves. Stealth Rocks and Substitute here. Gliscor also suffers from &#8220;I wish I had more than 4 moves&#8221; Syndrome, as he would kill to have Taunt, Earthquake, a Flying type move, Ice Fang, and Roost. But I need a Lead who can do his job and then toxic as many people as possible. Thanks to the Prostitute combo (Protect and Substitute) I can turn one turn of Protect invulnerability into 3 if I protect over a Substitute. This will really leave a dent into anyone who&#8217;s been already Toxic&#8217;d by Gliscor himself or Jellicent. Unfortunately, this leaves Gliscor totally Taunt bait.</li>
  <li>Enough with the stall. Let&#8217;s get to the races with our offensive core. <strong>Conkeldurr</strong> starts off our physical offense with an unsurprising (and somewhat predictable) set. Really, the only important choice here is Ice Punch vs Payback. In almost all other cases, Ice Punch usually gets the advantage because it provides great coverage to Fighting type pokemon who really need it, but we&#8217;re going to need Payback to give Conkeldurr something to check Psychic types with and our Ice problem is being covered by a different ace up our sleeve.</li>
  <li><strong>Jolteon</strong> has the speed that Conkeldurr lacks, outrunning nearly everything in the damn game, and God help anyone stupid enough to let you absorb an Electric attack with Volt Absorb. Meanwhile, Thunderbolt everything in sight, pack Hidden Power Ice to give Ground types something to think about, and use Signal Beam on the Grass types who switch in hoping to sponge an Electric attack. </li>
  <li>And last we come to <strong>Kingdra</strong>, who was actually the last addition to this team (regardless of what I said above). When it came down to it, my original selection for 6th was Kyurem-B, which would have left me with only 2 weaknesses to Fighting, but I felt like I could get a break somehow. </li>
</ul>

<p><span class="pullquote-right" data-pullquote="only 3 fully-evolved Pokemon without type weaknesses">
Did you know there are only 3 fully-evolved Pokemon without type weaknesses? You might guess the first one - Sableye! There&#8217;s another Dark/Ghost&#8230; Spiritomb! The last candidate is only without weakness because he has an ability (Levitate) which makes him immune to his only weakness of Ground: Elektross. However, all of these pokemon have mediocre stats to make up for their desirable typing, and I needed someone who could compete with the greatest Pokemon in the game.
</span>  </p>

<p>The only Dragon(s) not weak to Ice are Palkia and Kingdra, who share Water/Dragon as their typing. There&#8217;s no room for a Rain Dance strategy, so Kingdra is kind of left out on his own without being able to utilize his very scary Swift Swim ability. I mentioned above that most trainers expect a physical Kingdra, using Swift Swim to double speed and come out with crazy strong Waterfall and Outrage in the rain. We&#8217;ll attempt to surprise these people with a coverage-based Choice Specs special attacking Kingdra. Most are expecting the Waterfall, or the Outrage, but we run Draco Meteor and Hydro Pump. Ice Punch? Nah, Ice Beam.  Surf is the low-power high-accuracy back-up to Hydro Pump. </p>

<hr />

<p>This group of Pokemon literally can&#8217;t be swept by just one move. It&#8217;s got some flaws to it, an over-reliance on status (Thunder Wave, Scald, Will-o-wisp, Toxic on just Ferrothorn and Jellicent alone), over-reliance on entry hazards (Spikes and Stealth Rocks) when I don&#8217;t have any Whirlwinds or Roars to phaze and force switches, and a complete lack of Fire type moves. But other than the occasional Forretress or Scizor, this team is pretty cohesive.</p>

<p>And on that same token, this team can run circles around opponents if you have good prediction. Sporting complete immunity to 6 types on 4 pokemon and some unexpected 4x <strong>resistances</strong> to Water and Fire on Kingdra (Ferrothorn&#8217;s 4x resistance to Grass is offset by 4x weakness to Fire, but let&#8217;s not mention that), and this team is designed to take hits and just keep on punishing the enemy. </p>

<p>I think the stars of the team are Gliscor, Conkeldurr, and Kingdra. Once all Steel types have been eliminated (courtesy of Conkeldurr) then Gliscor can essentially one-man the entire enemy team, if you play Protect-Toxic-Substitute right. Start with Protect to scout for their move, Toxic when you have the opportunity, then Substitute like your life depended on it. You&#8217;d rather be at 10% health with Toxic, Substitute , and a guaranteed Protect up on the next turn, than 95% health with no more Protect (or at least likely to fail), no more Toxic than before, and no reason to stall with Substitute.</p>

<p>A Conkeldurr who can predict when to Bulk Up suddenly gets very strong and very scary, as the only special type who can give him a hard time (Psychic) is going to be extremely surprised by his Payback, since he&#8217;ll go slower than practically any Psychic type ever made. After that, Drain Punch the crap out of everything and use Mach Punch for the kill.</p>

<p>And lastly, we come to Kingdra, who hits like a truck when people aren&#8217;t expecting his special attacks. Watch as the enemy puts out a physically defensive Steel type to sponge your impending Outrage, and gets OHKO by a Draco Meteor instead. Watch Heatran get rolled by a Hydro Pump he wasn&#8217;t expecting, and Grass types won&#8217;t see Ice Beam coming either. The catch is that you&#8217;ll have to switch out after you get Choice&#8217;d in after every move, but THAT&#8217;S OK because you&#8217;ll want to switch out and get that Draco Meteor Sp. Attack debuff off you anyway. May I recommend switching out to Jellicent or Ferrothorn? I hear they&#8217;ve got some great defensive typing&#8230;</p>

<p>TL;DR:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I have just as many pokemon weak to the following types as I have pokemon that resist them: Flying, Ground, Ghost, Grass, Psychic, Ice, Dragon</li>
  <li>I have no pokemon weak to Poison, Rock, Bug, and Steel (with Normal assumed)</li>
  <li>I have <strong>at least 3</strong> pokemon resistant to Poison, Bug, Steel, Water, and Electric</li>
  <li>Note that no one weak to Rock means no one weak to Stealth Rock</li>
</ul>

<p>If anyone wants to watch some replays, I&#8217;ve got a bunch here:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://pokemonshowdown.com/replay/oucurrent-35083587">Gliscor stalls for 30 straight turns</a> - Jolteon could have handled Gliscor on the switch if I used Hidden Power Ice instead of Signal Beam. Meanwhile on Turn 26, 2v3 remaining and all I&#8217;ve got is Gliscor and a near-dead Conkeldurr. I Toxic his last two pokemon not named Gliscor and I&#8217;m trying my best to protect Conk because it&#8217;s the only thing that has a chance at killing gliscor (and unlikely at that - it just has physical moves vs enemy Gliscor&#8217;s physical defense and Protect). However, although I know I can stall out Heracross, Hydreigon will probably out-Roost me. Starting Turn 39 I spam Stealth Rock and Toxic (useless because every pokemon on the field is already Toxic and Rocks are already up as he has no spinner) just to wear down his Gliscor&#8217;s Protect and EQ PP. Outlasting the enemy turns a victory here.</li>
  <li><a href="http://pokemonshowdown.com/replay/oucurrent-35138920">Beating a Baton Pass team</a> - Would have lost this one if not for the INCREDIBLE Ferrothorn/Gliscor stall between Toxic and Leech Seed (Gliscor stall is becoming somewhat of a trend, isn&#8217;t it&#8230;). Stealth Rocks forces out Ninjask but the Baton Pass to Dragonite and later Milotic nearly ended me. Even worse, I don&#8217;t have any Fire moves to damage Metagross.</li>
  <li><a href="http://pokemonshowdown.com/replay/oucurrent-35159995">Stall Team SUPREME</a> - Just an absolutely lucky game on my part. Again, completely pulled out of my ass due to fantastic Gliscor stall. I lose Jolteon and Kingdra in the first 5 turns, and everything looks like it&#8217;s going to go to shit. However, this game really showcases how even on a team with reliance on Toxic stall, Burn has its uses. Not only do I get a Will-o-wisp burn on Bronzong (after attempting to hit Salamence before the switch with a Toxic), I get an <strong>exceedingly</strong> lucky Scald burn on Gyrados at Turn 18. Despite picking up Moxie stacks, his Gyrados is not a full-game threat to me any more. I pick off his pokemon one by one, before finally putting the &#8220;killing&#8221; blow on Salamence with a Toxic. The guy doesn&#8217;t even think that the Toxic will do me any good, but I start using Gliscor and Jellicent as body bags to build up Toxic damage, eventually bringing Salamence to OHKO range. He realizes how fucked he is, tries to switch in Bronzong (who I rip to shreds) and Salamence dies on the switch to Stealth Rock damage.</li>

<p>The Cleveland Indians hit the postseason in 1920, 1948, 1954, 1995-99, 2001, and 2007<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. The Pittsburgh Pirates made it in 1901-03, 1909, 1925, 1927, 1960, 1970-72, 1974-75, 1979, and 1990-92<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. This October (<a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23buctober">#Buctober</a>), both teams are in <a href="http://www.mlbplayoffsbracket.com/2013/index.php">the MLB postseason</a>, with records of 92-70 (Cleveland) and 94-68 (Pittsburgh), both records good for the #4 seed. This is the first time, in history, that these two teams have been in the playoffs at the same time, and also the first time that either team has gotten in with a wild card. It&#8217;s a great time to be a fan of these Lake Erie baseball teams. </p>

<p>The Pirates play the Reds tonight and the Indians play the Rays tomorrow night.</p>

    <id>http://www.speaksoftly.us/blog/distribution-of-the-modulus-of-a-random-variable</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We know that the distribution of the sum <script type="math/tex">Y = X_1 + X_2 + ... + X_n</script> for n 
random uniform variables approximates a normal distribution as n gets larger. 
For right now, we&#8217;re referring to the discrete uniform distribution, and not 
the continuous one.</p>

<p>Alright, rewind. Earlier this year, I had a technical interview and the 
following was an actual interview question: mimic <code>rand7</code>, given only <code>rand5</code>. 
For those of us lucky enough to work with a statistical language like <strong>R</strong>, 
we&#8217;ve got:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="r"><span class="line"><span class="o">&gt;</span> rand7 <span class="o">=</span> sample<span class="p">(</span><span class="m">1</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="m">7</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">1</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class="line"><span class="o">&gt;</span> rand5 <span class="o">=</span> sample<span class="p">(</span><span class="m">1</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="m">5</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">1</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>Boom. Problem done. Well, not exactly. The goal of this interview question is 
to figure out a way to expand the range of <code>rand5</code> while preserving the 
uniformity of each output value in <code>rand7</code>. I think it&#8217;s only a disarming 
question in an interview because we don&#8217;t often work with the intricacies of 
random number generation in our coursework. Even at a school like CMU, 
we&#8217;re usually dealing with the analysis of the distribution, not its transformations.
The most important task in this problem is to ensure that all 7 outputs have 
exactly equal probability of being output, even though you&#8217;re only being given 
enough &#8220;randomness&#8221; for 5 outputs. In more modern parlance, we have to pull 
some entropy <em>out of our ass</em>. </p>

<p>I&#8217;ve researched a couple solutions to this problem, and they range from simple 
to esoteric. One of the more complex options is to use our smaller RNG to 
uniformly build a larger generater than we actually need, then sample back 
down to the range we want. The second step, to sample back down, is guaranteed
to be uniform as long as we only sample within a particular range, seen below.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s generalize: suppose our problem was &#8220;given <code>rand2</code>, compute <code>rand3</code>.&#8221; </p>

<p>Really, this is the base case of our interview question, if you will. </p>

<p>And the beautiful thing is that if we consider the outputs of <code>rand2</code> as the 
paths along a binary tree, we can make a pretty powerful metaphor for this 
problem. So let&#8217;s say we take the left branch of our binary tree if 
<code>rand2 == 0</code> and the right branch if <code>rand2 == 1</code>. Every time we decide to 
call <code>rand2</code>, we have to add a level to the tree. At the bottom, we label each 
leaf node with a number: <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, or <code>3</code>. These labels are our RNG output. </p>

<p>If our tree has $j$ levels at the end, then we&#8217;ll make $j$ calls to <code>rand2</code>, take 
those paths, then return the label at the bottom-most leaf.</p>

<p>Without even considering how to decide which leaf nodes should be labeled 
what, we note that the probability of reaching any of the nodes labeled <code>3</code> 
would be to sum up the probabilities along the path to reach each such node 
labeled <code>3</code>. Since the probability to reach one particular node is 
<script type="math/tex">\tfrac{1}{2^j}</script> (where $j$ is the level in which the node is found), then the 
total probability to reach any of our nodes labeled <code>3</code> would be the sum of 
that. This makes the form of our probability statement something like 
<script type="math/tex"> \sum_j \tfrac{1}{2^j} = \tfrac{1}{2^a} + \tfrac{1}{2^b} + \tfrac{1}{2^c} + ...</script></p>

<p>The question is: is there a series of reciprocal powers <script type="math/tex">\{a, b, c, ...\}</script> 
such that <script type="math/tex">\tfrac{1}{3} = \tfrac{1}{2^a} + \tfrac{1}{2^b} + \tfrac{1}{2^c} + ...</script>?</p>

<p>And the answer is no, because 2 and 3 are <strong>relatively prime</strong>. Well that&#8217;s simple. Math is cool.</p>

<h2 id="so-what-do-we-do">So what do we do?</h2>

<p>We need to use our smaller RNG to generate a larger range than either RNG 
(think kind of like a least-common-multiple) and then reduce back down to the 
target RNG. Generation of the larger range can be done easily enough by 
&#8220;building&#8221; a large number, in a very literal sense. Reduction can also be done
easily with repeated sampling. </p>

<p>Let&#8217;s go back to our 5 &amp; 7 case.  What we&#8217;ll do is &#8220;create&#8221; a random base-5 
number with <code>num = 5 * (rand5() - 1) + (rand5() - 1)</code> and as long as &#8216;num&#8217; is 
less than 21 (in base 10) (41 in base 5), then its modulus by 7 will be 
uniform, because it is a multiple of 7 (in this case 3 * 7). You could 
realistically use any multiple of 7, I think. I&#8217;d really like it if somebody 
could back me up on that claim.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s the solution my interviewer emphatically claimed was the only solution:</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s get a couple criticisms out of the way. </p>

<ul>
  <li>The solution could run forever, but <script type="math/tex">\sum_{i=1}^{\infty} \tfrac{1}{2^i} = 1</script> converges, so you&#8217;ll get something eventually. </li>
  <li><em>It&#8217;s not intuitive at all</em>. </li>
</ul>

<p>It certainly wasn&#8217;t the first thing I thought of, yet it&#8217;s the &#8220;by-the-book&#8221; solution.</p>

<p>So let&#8217;s look at a different solution for this problem, and one which bothered 
me the moment I saw it work. You&#8217;d think that we want things to work, but I&#8217;m 
surprised because I feel like it <strong>shouldn&#8217;t</strong> work. It feels like this solution
is taking the easy way out, and then to top it all off, <strong>there&#8217;s no Google results</strong>
that suggest it&#8217;s even viable.</p>

<h2 id="well-take-seven-random-samples-of-15-add-them-up-and-take-their-modulus">We&#8217;ll take seven random samples of 1:5, add them up, and take their modulus.</h2>

<p>Wait&#8230; What the hell? </p>

<p><span class="caption-wrapper"><img class="caption" src="http://i.imgur.com/2cXZaaU.jpg" width="" height="" alt="It looks totally uniform!" title="It looks totally uniform!" /><span class="caption-text">It looks totally uniform!</span></span></p>

<p>Let&#8217;s look at it this way, the sum <script type="math/tex">Y = X_1 + X_2 + ... + X_n</script> for n random 
uniform variables approximates a normal distribution as n gets larger. 
Everybody agrees, yes? </p>

<p>Then right before that modulus, our hero <script type="math/tex">Y</script> should be something really 
close to a normal distribution with mean 21 and standard deviation <script type="math/tex">\sqrt{14}</script>. 
How close? </p>

<p><span class="caption-wrapper"><img class="caption" src="http://i.imgur.com/p7jID8z.jpg" width="" height="" alt="Pretty close." title="Pretty close." /><span class="caption-text">Pretty close.</span></span></p>

<p>The mean is 21 because that&#8217;s <script type="math/tex">E[Y] = E[\sum_i X_i] = \sum_i E[X_i]</script> by 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value#Linearity">linearity of expectation</a> 
and it just so happens that for a uniform random variable <script type="math/tex">X \sim Unif(a,b)</script>, 
<script type="math/tex">E[X] = \frac{a + b}{2}</script> so <script type="math/tex">E[Y] = 7 \times E[X] = 7 \times \frac{1+5}{2} = 7 \times 3 = 21</script>. 
The variance of a uniform distribution is (the really weird) <script type="math/tex">V[X] = \frac{n^2 - 1}{12}</script> 
where <script type="math/tex">n</script> is the number of discrete possibilities. Since we&#8217;re looking at 
the discrete uniform distribution from 1 to 5, that gives us 5 total choices 
and <script type="math/tex">V[X] = \frac{5^2 - 1}{12} = 2</script>. Then by linearity <script type="math/tex">V[Y] = V[\sum_i X_i] = \sum_i V[X_i] = 7 \times 2 = 14</script>. 
Thus, our standard deviation is <script type="math/tex">\sqrt{14}</script>.</p>

<p>So right before that modulus, we&#8217;re definitely working with some value that 
has been randomly drawn from <script type="math/tex">N(21,\sqrt{14})</script>. The normal distribution, a 
unimodal density curve, indicates that we should expect to get the sum 21 more 
often than any other number. Ok, it&#8217;s not a huge amount more, just about 4000 
times more than its neighbors 20 and 22.</p>

<p>Each row is one of our potential sum values of Y, the first column is the 
number of times that sum appeared in a simulation of one million iterations, 
and the second column is the corresponding modulus of that sum. Now, I figured 
the peak in the center should inflate the number of instances of <code>21 %% 7</code> so 
that it is the most-common-modulus value. As it turns out, while 21 
(and 21 mod 7 = 0) is the most common, 7 mod 7 = 0 and 35 mod 7 = 0 are the 
two <em>least</em> common. And in fact, it occurs in such perfect proportion that 
this cascades all along the normal distribution so that every modulus 
remainder has approximately equal number of sum values <script type="math/tex">Y</script> which are 
congruent modulo 7.</p>

<p>The normal distribution &#8220;folds&#8221; on itself in such a perfectly uniform way. </p>

<p>It&#8217;s like it was destined to be this way.</p>

<p>I couldn&#8217;t shake the feeling that the &#8220;proper&#8221; answer would be a truncated 
normal distribution. On the other hand, modulus can only return one of the 
integer values up to its base, and with 29 possibilities, we would run out of 
integers four times over. My presumption, again, was that we&#8217;d see the most 
modulus values at 21 mod 7 = 0. But where would 20 and 22 go? Well those 
modulus values fall into -1 (6 mod 7) and 1 mod 7. Then the next set would be 
at 5 mod 7 &amp; 2 mod 7, then 4 &amp; 3&#8230; then 3 &amp; 4. The wide tail support of our 
normal distribution folds over to smooth everything out. </p>

<p>So I did the only logical thing and turned to <a href="http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~cshalizi/">Cosma Shalizi</a> 
to ask him why the modulus of a non-uniform distribution would resolve to a 
uniform distribution in this way, emphasizing the way that the tails fold over 
each other.</p>

<h2 id="equidistribution">Equidistribution</h2>

<p>Cosma confirmed that it is more a factor of the modulus than the normal 
distribution. </p>

<p>Here, roughly speaking, is the trick: take a non-negative but discrete random variable <script type="math/tex">Y</script>, with probability mass function <script type="math/tex">f</script>. We want to know the probability that <strong>Y mod 7 = k</strong>, for each <script type="math/tex">k</script>. Fix <script type="math/tex">k=0</script>. Then</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% &lt;![CDATA[

\begin{align}
	Pr(Y mod 7 = 0) &=& Pr(Y=0) &+& Pr(Y=7) &+& Pr(Y=14) &+& ... \\
                    &=& f(0) &+& f(7) &+& f(14) &+& ... \\
\end{align}
 %]]&gt;</script>

<p>Now do this for all the other possible values of Y mod 7:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% &lt;![CDATA[

\begin{align}
	Pr(Y\mod 7=1) &=& f(1) + f(8) + f(15) + ... \\
    Pr(Y\mod 7=2) &=& f(2) + f(9) + f(16) + ... \\
	&...& \\
	Pr(Y\mod 7=6) &=& f(6) + f(13) + f(22) + ... \\
\end{align}
 %]]&gt;</script>

<p>Assume <script type="math/tex">f(y)</script> is about the same as <script type="math/tex">f(y+k)</script>, provided k is small, specifically if <script type="math/tex">% &lt;![CDATA[
k < 7 %]]&gt;</script>.  If we think of <script type="math/tex">Y = X_1 + X_2+ ... X_n</script> and let n get very big, this makes sense, the typical scale over which the distribution is going to change is going to get larger and larger, so that a difference of just 7 becomes negligible.  But now we can say that</p>

<ul>
  <li><script type="math/tex">f(0), f(1), ..., f(6)</script> are all about equal</li>
  <li>&#8230;</li>
  <li><script type="math/tex">f(7), f(8), ... f(13)</script> are all about equal, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>so</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display"> Pr(Y\mod 7 = 0) = Pr(Y \mod 7 = 1) = ~...~ = Pr(Y\mod 7 = 6) = \frac{1}{7} </script>

<p>Thus, we find that the distribution of <strong>Y mod k</strong> is uniform, regardless of whatever
distribution <script type="math/tex">Y</script> itself is drawn from. </p>

<p>When it comes to <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=statistics+jokes">statistics jokes</a> (why are there so few?), my hands-down favorite has to be the Paranormal Distribution. For 3 different classes at CMU, I&#8217;ve named my final projects team &#8220;Paranormal Distribution&#8221;, and it&#8217;s never let me down. I usually like to cite <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2465539/">A visual comparison of normal and paranormal distributions</a> by Matthew Freeman and just to see what the professor thinks on the Works Cited page. In my most recent project, I was even audacious enough to put it on the <a href="https://github.com/kgilbert-cmu/DataCriming">final report</a>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, &#8220;Paranormal Distribution&#8221; still remains my second-best team project name, ranking just under &#8220;Helen Keller&#8221;, the Wikipedia NLP project with <a href="https://github.com/dbmikus">Dylan</a> and <a href="https://github.com/minigeek">Chase</a>. That one goes on my resume.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<!-- more -->

<p>Today is the first time since February that I&#8217;m actually pushing something 
onto Octopress. Skimming over much of my Junior Spring semester at CMU, I was 
monstrously busy with some difficult classes (<a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~roni/10601/">Roni&#8217;s Machine Learning</a> 
and <a href="http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~cshalizi/uADA/13/">Cosma&#8217;s 402</a> just to name a few), 
then throw on top of that the <a href="http://www.cmusigmachi.org">Lambda Pi chapter</a>&#8217;s 
first semester of operation as a chapter. We held our first <a href="http://dd.cmusigmachi.org/">Derby Days</a> 
(<a href="https://github.com/sethvargo">Seth Vargo</a> deserves a mention for his 
incredible job on that website, which he did mostly alone), initiated our 
first class (for which I had the honor of being Ritual Chairman), graduated 
our first Seniors, and earned ourselves our first 
<a href="http://www.sigmachi.org/province-balfour-award">Province Balfour Award</a> (again, Seth). 
This summer, I&#8217;m looking forward to representing my fraternity chapter as the 
Delegate to our Grand Chapter held in Washington, D.C., and I might be making 
a cameo appearance at <a href="http://balfourltw.sigmachi.org/">BLTW</a>.</p>

<p>This summer, I&#8217;m back to work at CMU with another research division. For the 
next two months I&#8217;ll be doing geoparsing with <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~gelern/">Judith Gelernter</a> in LTI. 
The project has a lot of interesting background on social media interactons 
and I&#8217;m hoping it&#8217;ll give me lots of table-talk in the future, to piggy-back 
my previous research work at CMU. Recruiters love hearing about the weird 
stuff you can accomplish with current statistics methods. It&#8217;s like a weird 
arms race of who can come up with the most terrifying implications for user data.</p>

<p>Other than that, it seems like nothing has really changed since the beginning 
of the year, and it doesn&#8217;t even seem like it was that long ago. The only 
noticable difference that I can tell is that I&#8217;m using Spotify now instead of 
Pandora and I&#8217;m living with 4 of my brothers in an off-campus house instead 
of with 15 of my brothers in the Sigma Chi house.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today in Roni&#8217;s class we talked about picking fights. I think you&#8217;re within 
your rights to tackle your problem any way you want, but it&#8217;s an important 
battle to &#8220;pick the right fight&#8221;. </p>

<!-- more -->

<p>What I mean about &#8220;picking the right fight&#8221; in statistics, is to tread carefully
when you make conclusions about the analysis. Often, we&#8217;re trying to show or 
prove or disprove or undermine or support some claim given some data about
the claim. So let&#8217;s say we&#8217;ve performed some experiment and have two binary questions: 
Do we have enough data, and do we have low error?</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Option 1:
If you have tons of data and you have very low error, you should <strong>GO HOME</strong>. 
There&#8217;s nothing else to be done here. Finish up, because you aren&#8217;t
going to come up with anything interesting any more. Honestly, what could 
be more perfect? This is like the ideal, frictionless scenario.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Option 2: 
If you have not a lot of data and you have very high error, you should <strong>GO HOME</strong>.
There&#8217;s nothing which <strong>can</strong> be done here. It&#8217;s an abysmal situation. 
You can either continue to make poor predictions, or you could just start making 
shit up. Either way, you have to rethink your strategy. This is where picking the right fight comes in later.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Option 3:
If you have a lot of data but you have very high error, you should <strong>CRY</strong>.
You dun goofed. Either your data is totally irrelevant (you should do more 
statistical analysis), your algorithm is terrible (you should do more 
statistical analysis), or you did something terribly wrong. More statistical 
analysis wouldn&#8217;t hurt.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Option 4:
If you don&#8217;t have a lot of data but you have very low error, you should be <strong>SKEPTICAL</strong>.
It&#8217;s a fluke, do the test again. Don&#8217;t buy in to thinking that there&#8217;s a practically 
significant relationship between children&#8217;s shoe sizes and their IQ. You&#8217;re not thinking
through this clearly enough and you&#8217;re making mistakes along the way.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="so-what-option-are-you">So what option are you?</h2>

<p>Personally, I like being put into situation #2. There is some sort of morbid pleasure 
in being able to wreak order out of chaos. But if you&#8217;re going to go down that path, 
you need to be aware that you can only take those risks by picking the right fight. 
How could we rectify the situation (pick a better fight) if we have too little data to speak of?
How about bootstrapping more samples? How do we sample a more variable population if our
current data is too homogenous? How about bootstrapping the residuals? </p>

<p>OK, maybe you can just solve all of your problems by bootstrapping. Thanks 402.</p>

    <id>http://www.speaksoftly.us/blog/big-data-as-a-fad</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As a current student pursuing a career in data science, it really gets on my 
nerves when people ask me &#8220;What is Big Data?&#8221;, or worse, talk about how I 
should get &#8220;into&#8221; it. The problem is that the size of the data is not what 
makes data interesting. As a statistician, as a researcher in machine 
learning, or just as a student, we are far more interested in figuring out 
what to do with the <em>current</em> data, than worrying about big it is. </p>

<!-- more -->

<p>I get it. I need to be able to make accurate predictions and estimates and 
forecasts and I might need to do that without as much data as I want, but 
that&#8217;s a collection issue. Things don&#8217;t start falling into place just because
you have a database with a lot of dense stuff in it. Your data science is only
as good as the statistical analysis you put behind it. <em>True</em> Big Data is 
about leveraging the correct data, in the correct form, with the correct models.</p>

<p>On the other hand, we still have to deal with this &#8220;Big Data&#8221; word fiasco. 
It&#8217;s starting to become a household buzzword, which is a sure sign that it&#8217;s 
becoming &#8220;mainstream&#8221; and is no longer the corporate hipster slang it used to 
be. Go do a lookup for the keyword phrase &#8220;Big Data&#8221; on LinkedIn and take a 
look at the profiles that show up. We get lots of references to &#8220;Big Data&#8221; 
platforms and systems, but does anyone actually say &#8220;Yea, I do data analysis.&#8221;</p>

<p>No, they don&#8217;t.</p>

<p>And it&#8217;s just like 10 years ago when you had people clamoring to get in line 
for the &#8220;Data Mining&#8221; train. It created this false perception that somehow 
these incredible important nuggets of information are hidden behind a thick 
layer of dust and grime, but if we <strong>mine</strong> hard enough or use enough computers
then we&#8217;ll be able to find it! </p>

<p>Except that&#8217;s not how it works, either.</p>

<p>More likely than not, you&#8217;re searching for patterns, not nuggets. And you&#8217;ll
never know if you found your pattern or if you&#8217;re just looking at some more dirt.
You&#8217;ll need your statistics (or a friendly statistician on-hand) to interpret 
that dirt, and tell you how if you project the dirt into multidimensional 
scaling then you can reduce misclassification of future dirt, somehow.</p>

<p>The one good thing about all these people going heads-over-heels for Big Data 
is that everything is being recorded. The data is already out there, being 
voluntarily relinquished every day. Wait just long enough, and write a program
that&#8217;s <em>just</em> smart enough, and you can start connecting some really cool dots.</p>

<p>History will remember how the world was rocked by Web 2.0 (the &#8220;Social Revolution&#8221;
of everything we do online), but there&#8217;s another storm coming. For years now,
companies have been recording every ounce of data they can afford to store on 
a hard drive and the user is willing to part with. Then they hand off that 
information (they&#8217;ll tell you they never /sell/ it) to someone who can leverage it.
The more dirt they have, the better chance they&#8217;ll be able to polish that dirt
into a really cool training set of gold dirt, and then they&#8217;ll make tons of money.</p>

<p>So now the question for me is, &#8220;Who is going to be the one to leverage that data?&#8221; 
Big Data is nothing more than when your current data is too big for your current 
hardware. It&#8217;s a scaling problem, and it&#8217;s an engineering problem, but Big Data is not a 
scientific problem. Statistical analysis is a scientific problem, and I&#8217;ll try 
to position myself right at the front of that train. Web 3.0: the Data Revolution.</p>

    <updated>2013-02-08T14:22:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.speaksoftly.us/blog/hello-world-octopress-is-finally-running</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have pretty much no idea what business I have writing a blog. I have a terrible
attention span to writing. I think it looks really tacky when a blog goes
weeks or months in between posts. To make matters worse, I&#8217;m not super 
thrilled with my choice of domain (on the <code>.us</code> TLD), but there was a $3.99 sale 
at <a href="http://name.com">name.com</a> and I felt like it was a decent price. It gives 
me a little bit of a playground to play in without shelling out a dozen bucks
for a &#8220;real&#8221; <code>.com</code> website. </p>

<p>Getting Octopress set up was in and of itself an endeavor, but I&#8217;ll get the 
hang of it as time goes on. The host I&#8217;m using only lets me use static HTML 
files so Octopress was a very ideal system. It took maybe 16 hours to get the 
whole thing together. I had major issues with Ruby installation and raking 
files correctly. I&#8217;m pretty sure I still hate the command <code>bundle install</code>. 
I highly recommend those following in my footsteps to use <code>yari</code>.</p>

<p>One of the other things that attracted me to a blog was being able to publish code 
snippets in Markdown. Since I&#8217;ve gotten into using Markdown for my text files, 
I&#8217;ve started to enjoy just&#8230; writing Markdown. It&#8217;s kind of fun, and everything
comes out looking so nice. <a href="http://www.github.com/sethvargo">Seth</a> and I want to
port our chapter&#8217;s bylaws to Markdown so they&#8217;re not mired in the bullshit <code>.docx</code> 
they&#8217;re languishing in now. Not to say we&#8217;ll be publishing <code>LaTeX</code> in fraternity bylaws, 
but the Office format bothers me. A lot.</p>

<h2 id="speak-softly-and-carry-big-data">Speak Softly, and carry Big Data.</h2>

<p>As for the blog, I&#8217;m only here to talk about things that I&#8217;m really passionate 
about. Yes, a lot of that will come from my professional work. Expect lots of statistics,
math, some physics, and tons of programming thrown in. But I&#8217;ll also be here to
write about some of the stuff I get engaged with, and probably mention a lot of the 
Sigma Chi stuff I get involved in.</p>

<p>What else could be more important?</p>
